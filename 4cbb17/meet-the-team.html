            high
            school, I plan to attend college for a Computer Science degree, after college I would like to go into a
            computer
            science field most likely software engineering. I would consider myself fluent in Java so for a first-year
            team
            we are using Java as our programming language instead of the block programming language FTC suggests for new
            teams. </p>
